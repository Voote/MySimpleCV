## Reflection

This project checked my skills in creating simple Web Pages. I wanted to check how fast I can create WebPage from scratch using the simplest programming languages and tools. I'm glad that I could achieve that in less than a couple of hours.

In this project, I focus on using HTML with CSS, and by following the rules of Mobile First, RWD, BEM.
